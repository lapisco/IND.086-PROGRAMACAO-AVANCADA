def ifce(n1, n2, af):
    '''
    * ifce: Evaluation system of the Federal Institute of Cear√° (IFCE). *

    Parameters:
        n1: It is the student's first average. (Type: Float)
        n2: It is the student's second average. (Type: Float)
        af: It is of the Boolean type, for the true case the program calculates and returns the minimum for approval in the final exam. (Type: Boolean)
    Returns:
        The function returns a value of type Float or type None.
        If the Boolean flag is True (af), that is, if the student needs af, the function will return none,
        and show the average, and how much it needs in the final exam.
        If the flag is False, the function will return a value of type Float, being 1 if approved or 0 otherwise. (Type: Float or None)
